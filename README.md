*How do I approach designing software?* <br>
<b> What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?  </b>
- My ability to write reusable code has undoubtedly improved in terms of design skills. Programmatically generating the shape and modifying its scale and position made sense.<br><br>

<b> What design process did you follow for your project work? </b>
-  I went through this process iteratively. For example, I worked on the texture loading and got one texture per object to load. Then as I added objects, I'd add the texture for that object. I did for each object as I created them.<br><br>

<b> How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? </b>
- I used this iteration to divide the project into smaller, more manageable chunks. To gradually improve the project, I reviewed and modified the code based on feedback received, and implemented new teachings each week.<br><br>

*How do I approach developing programs?* <br>
<b> What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? </b>
- When I develop programs, I begin with a simple version and then refine it through iterative testing and improvement. This approach helps me identify and address issues early, allowing the program to evolve smoothly toward the desired outcome.<br><br>

<b> How did iteration factor into your development?  </b>
- Since I approached each subsystem iteratively, it allowed me to quickly flesh out what ideas did, and did not work, and which ideas are functional. It may not have complete functionality initially, but it provides a basis of how future iterations will work.<br><br>

<b> How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?  </b>
- For me, the milestones each week ended up being an interactive cycle. I ended up approaching each milestone a little bit differently and implementing each week's teachings. <br><br>

*How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?* <br>
<b> How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?  </b>
- Although I can see the benefits of working with graphic and visualizations, I don't think it will have a big influence on my course of study going forward. With my bachelor's degree almost finished, there isn't much time left to apply this knowledge in the classroom.<br><br>

<b> How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? </b>
- Occasionally, I might come across a project that asks me to render images or models in a three-dimensional setting. This might take the form of a 3D walkthrough for building plans or perhaps a display of the data results. My understanding of how to even make something like that work has increased as a result of working on this project.<br><br>
